:SetDescription("The Timed Explosive Charge, mostly knowns as C4, is an item often used when raiding other players. Once thrown, the charge will stick to walls, floors, doors and deployable items. Once attached to a target, the timed explosives will automatically detonate in a dependable and quick manner (in comparison to it's unreliable counterpart, the Satchel Charge). However, it does damage only to the structure it's attached to. If attached to a door, for example, it would destroy it without damaging the door frame or nearby walls. This item deals the most damage out of all explosive devices, and is the most ideal/useful for evicting your neighbors. It's important to protect this item from your enemies, as it can prove fatal once it's in the wrong hands.")

Note that sometimes the charge will re-ignite when the dud is picked up, going off with a very short fuse!")
